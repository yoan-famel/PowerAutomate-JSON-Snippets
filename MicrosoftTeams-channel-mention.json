# Automated Microsoft Teams POST with channel mention
/*Description:
  The code is utilizing several actions and expressions to accomplish this task. It starts by setting a recurrence interval of once a month. Next, it lists the channels available in the workspace, filters the array to find the "General" channel, and then retrieves its ID using an expression.

  After that, it gets the group ID of the team, which is the parent container for the channel, and then sends an HTTP request to post a message to the "General" channel. The message contains a subject with the current month and year, and the body of the message is an HTML-formatted text that mentions the "General" channel and requests a response from the team members.

  The mention is created using an "id" and a "mentionText" property, with the channel ID retrieved from the previous step. The code uses a JSON format for the request body and sets the content-type as application/json.
